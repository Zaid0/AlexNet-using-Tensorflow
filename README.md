# AlexNet-using-Tensorflow
I have used Tensorflow to replicate AlexNet so I can have better understanding on its architecture.
I have taken the data from a kaggle dataset you can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayushv322/animal-classification)

Please if you found something I can improve tell me.
